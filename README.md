TabMemFree
----

TabMemFree - is a Chrome extension that lowers RAM consumption and CPU load by "parking" tabs inactive for some time.
Parking is made by forwarding tab to an empty page similar to `about:blank`.
Later on, when you click on a parked tab, it is sent back to the original page by going one stap back in it's history.
The side effect is that "forward" history of tab may be lost, but this could be prevented by option in extension settings.
